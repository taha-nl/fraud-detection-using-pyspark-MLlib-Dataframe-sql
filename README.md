# Fraud Detection using PySpark Mlib
Financial fraud detection is a challenge that must be taken seriously. Although fraudulent transactions are rare and represent only a very small fraction of the activity within an organization. However, a small percentage of the activity can quickly turn into significant financial losses and negative reputational effects on the organization. It is for this reason that effective fraud detection mechanisms play an essential role in protecting the interests of organizations against these negative effects. The primary objective of this work is to develop an application for detecting fraudulent transactions using the Apache Spark MLlib library, then compare the different fraud detection algorithms.we use a dataset from kaggle
